When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share with other developers easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It Git automatically pulled changes, it may overwrite some of your existing work.
