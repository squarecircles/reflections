How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The diff allows you to see what was changed recently.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can revert to previous changes if needed and start from a different state.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Having versions automaticaly saved would result in too many versions of a file, some that may not have any significant changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It makes sense to bundle all the related changes into one commit instead of saving individually so it's easier to compare with previous changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat will display the commit history and some stats.
git diff diff_id1 diff_id2 will display a diff for those two diff ids.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can checkout previous commits to undo invalid changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To write new apps.
